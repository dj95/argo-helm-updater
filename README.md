  This tool helps you to identify and update your helm charts, that are deployed with argocd.
  It retrieves all `Application` CRDs from the given context and namespace. Since these
  applications contain all information about the helm deployment, if one is used, this tool
  queries the given repository for the latest chart version and displays a difference, if
  a newer version is deployed.
